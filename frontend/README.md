# Hillside Medical Group - Appointment Booking

This repository contains the frontend code for the Hillside Medical Group's online appointment booking platform. The application is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS. It provides a seamless, multi-step form for patients to book appointments across various clinics and specializations.

-   **Three Core Sections**: Caters to "Universal Section Clinics," "Women's Wellness of SA," and "Psychiatry of SA."
-   **Real Data Integration**: The form dynamically loads clinic locations and associated providers from a centralized data source.
-   **Professional UI/UX**: A clean, responsive design with a blue and white theme, featuring intuitive components and subtle hover effects.
-   **Appointment Confirmation**: Generates a professional-looking digital appointment card upon successful booking, complete with a QR code for easy calendaring.
-   **Component-Based Architecture**: Built with reusable React components for maintainability and scalability.
